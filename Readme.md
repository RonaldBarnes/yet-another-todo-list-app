### Yet Another Todo List App

#### Fullstack Project with NodeJS


Featuring:
* NodeJS
* Express
* Mongoose / MongoDB
* jQuery

Listens on port 8123.

See the **api** branch, which includes a frontend.


#### Frontend Project with ReactJS


The front-end is unnecessary & deprecated.

Use the todos-api on port 8123 instead.

See the **app** branch (again, it's deprecated).



This repository consists of 2 separate repos that were merged into two branches
of one repository.  The API branch contains everything required to run a
todo list, and is styled in a much more modern way.
